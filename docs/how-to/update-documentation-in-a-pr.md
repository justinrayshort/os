# How to Update Documentation in a Pull Request

Canonical how-to content has been migrated to the GitHub Wiki:

- [`wiki/How-to-Update-Documentation-in-a-Pull-Request.md`](../../wiki/How-to-Update-Documentation-in-a-Pull-Request.md)

This repo-native page remains as a validated pointer in the `docs/` corpus so maintainers can discover the workflow from repo governance docs without maintaining duplicate step-by-step procedures.

## Pointer Notes

- Update the canonical procedure in the wiki page above.
- Keep this pointer page in sync only if the wiki page name/path changes.
- Use the PR checklist to confirm `wiki/` submodule pointer updates when wiki content changes.
