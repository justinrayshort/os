# How to Update Documentation in a Pull Request

Canonical how-to content has been migrated to the GitHub Wiki:

- [GitHub Wiki: How to Update Documentation in a Pull Request](https://github.com/justinrayshort/os/wiki/How-to-Update-Documentation-in-a-Pull-Request)

This repo-native page remains as a validated pointer in the `docs/` corpus so maintainers can discover the workflow from repo governance docs without maintaining duplicate step-by-step procedures.

## Pointer Notes

- Update the canonical procedure in the wiki page above.
- Keep this pointer page in sync only if the wiki page name/path changes.
- Record the external wiki branch and commit SHA in the PR description or review notes when wiki content changes.
