# Explanation: Documentation Architecture and Governance

Canonical explanation content has been migrated to the GitHub Wiki:

- [`wiki/Explanation-Documentation-Architecture-and-Governance.md`](../../wiki/Explanation-Documentation-Architecture-and-Governance.md)

This repo-native page remains as a validated pointer so documentation-system governance references can continue to route maintainers to the canonical wiki explanation without duplicating narrative content.

## Scope Boundary

- Canonical explanation narrative: wiki page above
- Normative contracts/SOP requirements: `docs/reference/*` and `docs/sop/*`
