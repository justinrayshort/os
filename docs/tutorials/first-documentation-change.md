# Tutorial: Make Your First Documentation Change

Canonical tutorial content has been migrated to the GitHub Wiki:

- [`wiki/Tutorial-First-Documentation-Change.md`](../../wiki/Tutorial-First-Documentation-Change.md)

This repo-native page remains as a validated pointer to preserve discoverability within the machine-validated `docs/` corpus and to prevent duplicate maintenance of tutorial content.

## Workflow Entry Point

For the current contribution procedure, use the canonical wiki guide and keep the `wiki/` submodule pointer updated in the same PR when wiki content changes.
