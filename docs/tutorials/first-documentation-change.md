# Tutorial: Make Your First Documentation Change

Canonical tutorial content has been migrated to the GitHub Wiki:

- [GitHub Wiki: Tutorial - First Documentation Change](https://github.com/justinrayshort/os/wiki/Tutorial-First-Documentation-Change)

This repo-native page remains as a validated pointer to preserve discoverability within the machine-validated `docs/` corpus and to prevent duplicate maintenance of tutorial content.

## Workflow Entry Point

For the current contribution procedure, use the canonical wiki guide and record the external wiki branch/SHA in PR or review notes when wiki content changes.
