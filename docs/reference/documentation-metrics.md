# Documentation Metrics and Observability

## Core Metrics

- `% endpoints covered in reference`
- `% public Rust APIs documented (enforced via `missing_docs` warnings + review policy)`
- `% documents reviewed within 180 days`
- `% wiki instructional pages using the required template`
- `% doc workflow pages routing to Cargo-managed commands`
- `broken_link_count`
- `rustdoc_doctest_pass_rate` (local verification signal)
- `wiki_structure_validation_status`
- `wiki_commit_sha_recorded` (review checklist signal when wiki pages change)
- `tutorial completion time` (user research / analytics input)
- `top visited pages` (if analytics enabled)

## Audit Report Fields

Generated by `cargo xtask docs audit-report`:

- `document_count`
- `markdown_count`
- `counts_by_category`
- `fresh_review_percent`
- `stale_documents`
- `broken_internal_links`
- `mermaid_block_count`
- `openapi_spec_count`
- `validation_issue_counts.wiki`
- `validation_issue_counts.frontmatter`
- `validation_issue_counts.links`
- `validation_issue_counts.sop`

## Usage

- Review during quarterly documentation audit.
- Track regressions in saved audit artifacts (for example `.artifacts/docs-audit.json` attached to reviews).
- Prioritize high-risk knowledge gaps first (auth, integrity, deployment, recovery, invariants).
- Use command-routing and wiki-template metrics to catch drift before it turns into contributor workflow confusion.
