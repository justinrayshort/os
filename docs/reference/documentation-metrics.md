# Documentation Metrics and Observability

## Core Metrics

- `% endpoints covered in reference`
- `% public Rust APIs documented (enforced via `missing_docs` warnings + review policy)`
- `% documents reviewed within 180 days`
- `broken_link_count`
- `rustdoc_doctest_pass_rate` (CI signal)
- `wiki_structure_validation_status`
- `tutorial completion time` (user research / analytics input)
- `top visited pages` (if analytics enabled)

## Audit Report Fields

Generated by `scripts/docs/validate_docs.py audit-report`:

- `document_count`
- `markdown_count`
- `counts_by_category`
- `fresh_review_percent`
- `stale_documents`
- `broken_internal_links`
- `mermaid_block_count`
- `openapi_spec_count`
- `validation_issue_counts.wiki`

## Usage

- Review during quarterly documentation audit.
- Track regressions in CI artifacts.
- Prioritize high-risk knowledge gaps first (auth, integrity, deployment, recovery, invariants).
